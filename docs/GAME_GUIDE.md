## How to Play

### Turn Structure

Each turn follows these steps:

1. **Draw a Card**
   - Draw one card from the deck
   - You now have two cards in hand

2. **Choose and Play a Card**
   - Select one of your two cards to play
   - Discard it to the discard pile
   - Apply the card's effect (if applicable)

3. **End Turn**
   - Keep your remaining card
   - Next player's turn begins

### Special Rules

**Mandatory Discard**: If you hold the Countess (7) and either the King (6) or Prince (5), you **must** discard the Countess.

**Protection**: Players protected by the Handmaid cannot be targeted by any card effects until their next turn.

**Elimination**: Eliminated players sit out for the rest of the round but return for the next round.

---

## Card Effects in Detail

### 👰 Princess (8)
**Effect**: If you discard this card, you are immediately eliminated.

**When to Play**:
- When you have no other choice (e.g., forced by Prince effect)
- Never voluntarily discard the Princess!

**Strategy**: The Princess is the strongest card. Try to keep it until the end of the round.

---

### 💃 Countess (7)
**Effect**: If you have the King or Prince in your hand, you must discard the Countess.

**When to Play**:
- Automatically when you have King or Prince
- As a bluff to make others think you had a King or Prince

**Strategy**: Sometimes revealing you have the Countess gives away information, so be strategic.

---

### 👑 King (6)
**Effect**: Trade your hand with another player of your choice.

**When to Play**:
- When you have a low-value card and want to swap
- To steal what you suspect is a high-value card
- To force someone to take your Countess

**Strategy**: Great for obtaining the Princess or forcing opponents to eliminate themselves.

**Important**: Remember the Countess rule - if you draw a Countess while holding a King, you must immediately discard the Countess.

---

### 🤴 Prince (5)
**Effect**: Choose any player (including yourself) to discard their hand and draw a new card.

**When to Play**:
- To force suspected Princess holders to discard
- To refresh your own hand when stuck with a low card
- To eliminate players who discard the Princess

**Strategy**: Risky but powerful. Can instantly eliminate the Princess holder.

**Special Case**: If the deck is empty, the targeted player draws the set-aside card (2-player game) or draws nothing and is eliminated.

**Important**: If you force yourself to discard and draw the Countess while holding the Prince you just drew, you must immediately discard the Countess.

---

### 👸 Handmaid (4)
**Effect**: Until your next turn, you cannot be targeted by any card effects.

**When to Play**:
- When you have a high-value card and want to protect it
- When you suspect others might target you
- To buy time and gather information

**Strategy**: Excellent defensive card. Use it to protect the Princess or other high cards.

**Limitation**: If all other players are protected by Handmaids, you must choose yourself as a target (if the card requires a target).

---

### 🎩 Baron (3)
**Effect**: Choose another player. Both players reveal their hands. The player with the lower value is eliminated.

**When to Play**:
- When you have a high card (6, 7, or 8)
- After using Priest to know what someone has
- Against players who discarded low cards

**Strategy**: Information is power. Use the Priest before playing Baron for guaranteed elimination.

**Tie**: If both cards are equal, nothing happens.

---

### ⛪ Priest (2)
**Effect**: Look at another player's hand secretly.

**When to Play**:
- Early in the round to gather information
- Before playing Baron or Guard
- To track who might have the Princess

**Strategy**: Knowledge is crucial. Use this to inform your later decisions.

**Remember**: Keep the information to yourself! Don't reveal what you saw.

---

### 🛡️ Guard (1)
**Effect**: Choose another player and name a card (not Guard). If they have that card, they are eliminated.

**When to Play**:
- When you have information from Priest
- To eliminate suspected Princess holders
- As a educated guess based on discards

**Strategy**: Most common card. Use deduction based on:
- Cards already played
- What cards people might logically hold
- Your own hand

**Restriction**: You cannot guess "Guard" (too easy).

2. **Card Counting**
   - Remember what's been discarded
   - Calculate probabilities of remaining cards
   - Adjust strategy based on what's left

3. **Timing Matters**

4. **Target Selection**
   - Eliminate strong players first
   - Target those who've played few cards
   - Avoid protected players

### Advanced Tactics

**Bluffing with Discards**
- Discard Countess to make others think you have King/Prince
- Use this to manipulate opponent decisions

**The Princess Dilemma**
- If you have the Princess, play defensively
- Use Handmaids to protect it
- Be wary of Prince effects

**Baron Combos**
- Use Priest → Baron combination for guaranteed kills
- Only play Baron when you're confident

**Guard Deduction**
- Eliminate impossible cards based on discards
- Narrow down options systematically
- Make educated guesses, not random ones

**King Manipulation**
- Swap bad cards for good ones
- Force opponents into difficult situations
- Use to avoid the Countess rule

## Common Scenarios

### Scenario 1: You Have Princess + Handmaid
**Best Play**: Play the Handmaid to protect your Princess. This buys you a turn and prevents anyone from forcing you to discard.

---

### Scenario 2: You Have King + Countess
**Best Play**: You must discard the Countess (mandatory). This reveals to others that you had a King, so expect to be targeted.

---

### Scenario 3: You Used Priest and Saw Princess
**Best Play**:
- If you have Baron: Play it on that player to eliminate them
- If you have Prince: Force them to discard the Princess
- If you have Guard on your next turn: Call Princess to eliminate them

---

### Scenario 4: Only 2 Cards Left in Deck
**Best Play**: Consider holding onto higher cards. The round is likely to end with comparison rather than elimination.

---

### Scenario 5: Everyone Else is Protected by Handmaid
**Best Play**:
- If your card requires a target, you must target yourself
- Play a card that doesn't require targeting (Handmaid, Countess)
- Wait until next turn when protections expire

---

### Scenario 6: You Have Prince + Prince
**Best Play**: Use Prince on yourself first to draw a new card. This is risky but can improve your position, especially late in the round.
